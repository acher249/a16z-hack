# ExplAIn - Bringing Historic Artifacts Alive

This project was built for the a16z and OpenAI Consumer IA hackathon in NYC on 11/09/2024. This project is an education tool to make learning more fun, allowing anyone to bring historic artifacts alive. For example let a statue of Lucius Verus tell you about himself and the Roman Empire.

This project uses Luma Labs WebGL SDK and scanning technology as well as AI APIs from ElevenLabs and Captions. Built on AWS extending the below SST demo-notes-app (https://github.com/sst/demo-notes-app)


# --- built on top of SST's AWS serverless, React,Terraform Notes sample below ----

The [SST Guide](https://sst.dev/guide) is a comprehensive open source tutorial for building and deploying full-stack apps using serverless and React on AWS.

We create a note taking app from scratch â€” [**demo.sst.dev**](https://demo.sst.dev)

![Demo App](screenshot.png)

We use React.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito. This repo is a full-stack serverless app built with SST.

- The `infra/` directory defines our AWS infrastructure.
- The `packages/functions` directory contains the Lambda functions that power the CRUD API.
- The `packages/frontend` directory contains the React app.

It's a single-page React app powered by a serverless CRUD API. We also cover how add user authentication, handle file uploads, and process credit card payments with Stripe.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started:

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file)
2. [Install the SST CLI](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/reference/cli/)

### Usage

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sst/notes.git
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

This project uses a secret that we are not checking in to the repo. Make sure to [create one before deploying](https://sst.dev/chapters/handling-secrets-in-sst.html).

```bash
sst secret set StripeSecretKey <YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_TEST_KEY>
```

#### Developing Locally
http://localhost:5173/

From your project root run: // Ajc: run this for localhost
```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will start your frontend and run your functions [Live](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/live/).

#### Deploying to Prod

Run this in the project root to deploy it to prod.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage prod
```


Make sure to set your secret for prod as well.

```bash
sst secret set StripeSecretKey <YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_TEST_KEY> --stage production
```
